Hello! These files are some of the projects I, along with friends and the help of the internet/AI, completed for my Introduction to Python class (Comp I) for University. 
I study in UFRJ (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro), a Brazilian University, hence why all the variable names and comments are in portuguese. 
Both of these files represent interactive games:
The first is a simplified version of a children's memory game, where the users can choose the size of the game, the number of players, and 
compete against one another to see whoever is able to gather more pairs of numbers. 
The second is a Sudoku solver, where the code is able to create a Sudoku and solve it in 3 different difficulties, as well as accept a Sudoku board input from a user and solve it. 
The intention of these files are just to learn Python while having fun creating games for people. 
Hope you like it!
